# Our-Solar-System

The 2D representation of our solar system looks at two modes.

Scale Mode:
This mode allows one to compare the sizes of the planets relative to each other and shows just how big a difference there is between Jupiter, the biggest planet, and Mercury, the smallest planet.

Distance Mode:
This mode compares the average distances between the planets, showing how the planets get further and further away from each other as one travel outwards from the Sun.
